INTRODUCTION                                *bullets* *bullets-intro*

Bullets.vim is a plugin allowing automated (as in auto completing and auto
incrementing) bulleted lists in Vim. It is designed to closely emulate the
experience of working with a familiar word processor which presents the users
with the next bulleted item, leaving the user focused on what they need to
write.

Out of the box bullets.vim comes with built in support for the following list
types:

- Hyphenated lists
* Star (or bullet) lists
- [ ] GFM markdown checkbox lists
1. Numeric lists
2) or this style of numeric lists

Future versions aim to support the following:

a. Alphabetic lists
]] User defined bullets


GENERAL COMMANDS                            *bullets-commands*

                                            *bullets-:SelectCheckbox*
:SelectCheckbox        Visually selects the checkbox related to the current
                       item the cursor is on (works only in normal mode)

                                            *bullets-:SelectCheckboxInside*
:SelectCheckboxInside  Visually selects the contents of a checkbox related to
                       the current item the cursor is on (works only in normal
                       mode)

                                            *bullets-:ToggleCheckbox*
:ToggleCheckbox        Places an x in the nearest checkbox to the cursor on
                       the current line if it is unchecked. If the checkbox is
                       already checked, it removes the x from the checkbox.

                                            *bullets-:SelectBulletText*
:SelectBulletText      Selects the text of a bullet list item without the
                       bullet.

                                            *bullets-:SelectBullet*
:SelectBullet          Selects the bullet list item including the bullet.

                                            *bullets-:InsertNewBullet*
:InsertNewBullet       This is the command being used when you press <CR> in
                       INSERT mode or `o` in normal mode. It adds the next
                       bullet list item based on the one in the current line.


CONFIGURATION                               *bullets-configuration*

You can choose which file types this plugin will work on:

>
let g:bullets_enabled_file_types = ['markdown', 'text', 'gitcommit']
>

Above are the defaults, but feel free to add or modify this list to suit your
needs. Just add above to your .vimrc.

To check the type of the current file type `:set ft` into the vim command
line.

To disable default mappings add the following to your .vimrc:

>
let g:bullets_set_mappings = 0
>

Now you can use the provided |bullets-commands| to define your own mappings.

To add a leader key to all mappings set the following:

>
let g:bullets_mapping_leader = "\<Space>"
>

This will set the <space> key as leader to all default mappings.


INSERTING BULLETS                           *bullets-insert-new-bullet*

When a supported file type is opened (see |bullets-configuration|) you can start
a bullet list by typing the first member of a supported bullet list type (see
|bullets|).

Pressing the <CR> key in insert mode at the end of a bullet list item will
insert the next bullet.

Pressing the <CR> key when a bullet is empty (e.g. `- `) will start a new line
and erase the empty bullet.

In normal mode you may press `o` to open a new line which will also create the
next bullet list item and put the cursor right after it.


INDENTING BULLETS                           *bullets-indenting*

Bullets.vim comes built in with support for indenting and de-indenting
bullets.

To indent the current bullet to the right: from insert mode press <CTRL-l>.
To indent the current bullet to the left: from insert mode press <CTRL-h>.


GFM MARKDOWN CHECKBOXES                     *bullets-checkboxes*

Bullets.vim supports checking and unchecking GFM markdown checkboxes. While in
normal mode, move over a checkbox list item (anywhere on the item) and use
<leader>x to toggle the checkbox state.

There are also |bullets-commands| that you can use to to create your own mappings.


MAPPINGS                                    *bullets-mappings*

To disable the default mappings see |bullets-configuration|.

INSERT MODE


                                            *bullets-i_<cr>*
<CR>        Inserts a new bullet list item based on the current line bullet
            format. This a local mapping and will only affect the current buffer
            if it has a supported file type (see |bullets-configuration|).

                                            *bullets-i_<C-cr>*
<C-CR>      Same as <CR>, in case you want to unmap <CR> in INSERT MODE.

                                            *bullets-i_<C-l>*
<C-l>       Indent current bullet list item to the right by two spaces.

                                            *bullets-i_<C-h>*
<C-h>       Indent current bullet list item to the left by two spaces.

NORMAL MODE

                                            *bullets-o*
<o>         Inserts a new bullet list item. Same as <CR> in INSERT MODE.

                                            *bullets-<leader>x*
